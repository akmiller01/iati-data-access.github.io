# Data Notes

As part of its 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, IATI's first objective is to drive a significant improvement in the quality of data published to IATI. As noted in the [introduction](/introduction/#_1-1-supporting-partner-country-governments-to-better-access-and-use-iati-data), recent years have seen a significant improvement in the quality of data published.

Given the continuing issues around the quality of data currently published by different publishers, IATI data still needs to be handled with caution. However, it is also important to “unpack” this conversation: some publishers’ data is now of a very good quality, and with appropriate care, can be useful. The purpose of this data notes section is to provide a simple overview of publishers’ data.

## 3.1 Fields in output data

For each country, two files are published, containing a common set of fields for all activities. The files have been designed so that a pivot table can be added on top of the data, in order to aggregate and summarise the data in various different ways, depending on user needs.

## 3.2 Data gaps by year

The following table shows each publisher and the total amount of funding (in millions of USD) found in their published data after processing, for all countries/regions. It includes the past three years (for commitments and disbursements) and the next three years (for budgets).

This will identify overall data gaps that you may need to be aware of. Data gaps (where USD 0.00 was found) are highlighted in yellow.

<DataGapsYear />
